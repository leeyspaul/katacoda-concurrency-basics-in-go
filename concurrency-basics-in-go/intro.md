In this scenario you will learn how to synchronize concurrent code with Go channels and WaitGroups.

By the end of this scenario you'll be able to 
* Test your code for data races
* Synchronize code with blocking channels
* Synchronize code with WaitGroups

We expect that you have some familiarity with Go and writing concurrent code. If all of this sounds good, let's get started!
