Welcome to Avoiding data races in Go! In this scenario we'll learn the basic blocking techniques to synchronize concurrent code with Go channels and WaitGroups.

By the end of this scenario you'll be able to 
* Quickly test your code for data races
* Synchronize code with blocking channels
* Synchronize code with WaitGroups

We expect that you have some familiarity with Go and writing concurrent code. If all of this sounds good, let's get started!
